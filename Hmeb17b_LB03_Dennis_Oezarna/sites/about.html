                <p class="txt_about">"I don't try to just catch the moment but always the emotions and backstory of the people I find interesting. With photography comes a lot of patience, luck and also dedication. Something I try to visualize in my pictures. I am not a professional photographer. It is more a kind of funny thing to do mostly when I am on vacation. Obviously I am into breathtaking panoramas but quite recently I have built an interest in portrait photography. Something I don't want is that people look posed." <br>
